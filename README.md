# FileCopier

<h1>Approach</h1>

-> The challenge is implemented with Java language.<br>
-> I have used java in-built file handling character stream classes like File, FileReader, FileWriter etc.<br>
-> My Approach is to take source path , file name and destination path as user input after which initializing file object.<br>
-> After getting file objects I am checking if file exists by using in-built method file.exists(). <br>
-> If file exists and if both input and output objects are same and exist then I'll first I'll create new file naming it with "-copy" and appending appropriate number.
