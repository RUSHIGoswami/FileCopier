# FileCopier

<h3>Approach</h3>

-> The challenge is implemented with Core Java.<br>
-> I have used java in-built file handling character stream classes like File, FileReader, FileWriter etc.<br>
-> These classes are of Java.utils and Java.io packages.<br>
-> I have used the throws keyword for handling exceptions such asÂ FileNotFoundException, IOException.<br>
-> My Approach is to take source path , file name and destination path as user input after which initializing file object.<br>
-> After getting file objects it is checking if file exists by using in-built method file.exists(). <br>
-> If file exists and if both input and output objects are same and exist then, first it'll create new file naming it with "-copy" and appending appropriate number.<br>
-> It'll make one object of FileReader to read the source file and FileWriter object to write into new renamed destination file.
